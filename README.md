The goal of the game is to find a set from the cards on the board. Each card will have 
several features and several options for each feature. For example, a feature could be
color and the options could be red, blue, or green. A set is a selection of cards where, 
for each feature, every card either has the same option or every card has a different option.
In the game, you start with two lives and you need to get through 4 levels. You can make it 
easier and harder by changing the number of features and options. If you are struggling, you
can press h to get some hints.
